1. Inactivity Warning System

Implement a floating warning popup in the HR dashboard when:

a) Mouse Inactivity

If the HR does not move the mouse for 120 seconds, show a floating popup:

“⚠️ You have been inactive for 2 minutes.”

Should cover the screen lightly but not block work.

Should log this event as a ‘Mouse Inactivity Warning’.

b) Keyboard Misuse

Track keyboard behavior:

If HR does not press any key for 120 seconds → show “Keyboard inactive warning”.

If HR long-presses any key (press duration > 3 seconds) → show:

“⚠️ Long key-press detected.”

Each warning should be logged with:

HR ID

Timestamp

Warning Type

Browser info

2. Tab Switch Monitoring

Whenever HR switches from the working web page to another tab:

Record the URL of the tab switched to.

Record the time spent on that tab before returning.

Save each event in the backend database:

HR ID

Switched-To URL

Time spent outside

Timestamp

This should be called a “Tab Distraction Event”.

3. Warning & Activity Logging

Every warning or distraction event must be saved in the database with:

HR Name

HR ID

Timestamp

Warning Type (Mouse inactivity, Keyboard inactivity, Long key press, Tab switch)

Extra metadata: URL, duration, device info, browser info

4. Manager Dashboard (Monitoring & Analytics)

In the Manager Login, add a new menu option:

🔹 Productivity (Sidebar Menu)

Inside this module:

a) HR List View

Show the list of all HRs.

Each HR card/row should show:

HR Name

Total warnings today

Total tab switches

Productivity score

b) Detailed View (OnClick per HR)

When the Manager clicks an HR:

Show the following data with statistics + visuals:

Total inactivity warnings

Total keyboard misuse events

Total tab switch distractions

URLs visited during tab switches (full list)

Time spent on each external URL

Daily & weekly graphical charts:

Bar chart → number of warnings

Line chart → productivity trend

Pie chart → warning distribution

5. Overall Productivity Score Calculation

Create a dynamic score formula like:

Score = 100 - (InactivityCount * 2 + TabSwitchCount * 3 + KeyboardWarnings * 1.5)


Display this score visually (speedometer gauge or colored badge).

Productivity color coding:

Green = 80–100

Yellow = 50–79

Red = 0–49
